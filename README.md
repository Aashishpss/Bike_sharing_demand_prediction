## Bike Sharing Demand Prediction
# Overview

This project uses a dataset containing bike-sharing rental information to predict the number of bikes rented in a given timeframe. The goal is to explore and analyze the dataset, preprocess the data, and build a predictive model to forecast bike demand using various statistical and machine learning techniques.
Features

    Data Preprocessing:
        Mapping categorical variables to human-readable formats (e.g., seasons, months, weekdays).
        Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
        Handling multicollinearity by removing highly correlated features.
        Scaling numerical features for better model performance.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Visualizing distributions of numerical features.
        Using boxplots to analyze the relationship between categorical features and the target variable (cnt).
        Heatmaps to identify correlations between features.

    Model Building and Evaluation:
        Feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).
        Building and fine-tuning a multiple linear regression model.
        Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like R² score and residual analysis.

How to Run

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bike-sharing-prediction.git
    cd bike-sharing-prediction

    Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment.

    Upload the dataset (BoomBikes.csv) into the working directory.

    Run the notebook to:
        Understand the dataset.
        Visualize trends and relationships in the data.
        Preprocess the data.
        Train and evaluate predictive models.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Distribution plots for numerical variables like temp, windspeed, and cnt.
    Boxplots showing the impact of features like season, month, and weather on the target variable.
    Heatmaps to explore correlations and identify multicollinearity.

Data Preprocessing

    Mapping and encoding categorical features.
    Dropping irrelevant or highly correlated features (e.g., atemp).
    Scaling numerical variables for consistent model performance.
    Splitting the data into training and test sets (70-30 split).

Modeling Approach

    Feature Selection:
        Used Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select the most important predictors.
        Reduced the number of features in a step-by-step manner, ensuring minimal loss of performance.

    Linear Regression:
        Built an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model using Statsmodels.
        Optimized the model by removing features with high multicollinearity (evaluated via VIF).

    Model Evaluation:
        R² score to measure goodness of fit.
        Scatter plots to compare actual vs. predicted bike rentals.
        Residual analysis to validate model assumptions.

Results

    Training Performance:
        Model fit and summary indicate significant predictors and overall fit.

    Test Performance:
        Achieved an R² score of approximately (insert R² score) on the test dataset.
        Predictions closely align with actual bike rentals.

Visualizations

    Pair plots to analyze relationships between features.
    Heatmaps for correlation analysis.
    Scatter plot comparing predicted and actual rentals.
    Boxplots to show feature impacts on target variable.

Future Work

    Experiment with advanced machine learning models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting.
    Explore time-series analysis to predict bike demand.
    Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.
